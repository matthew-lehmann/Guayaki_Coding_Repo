This is the source code for our project. The Unity files include all of the game design coding scripts and assets
(as well as the application itself). The EJS files for the website are then included everywhere else. If you would
like to run the game, simply download the application for the appropriate OS (windows or OSMac). To visit the
website simply go to: www.guayaki.herokuapp.com.
