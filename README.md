This is the source code for our project. The Unity files include all of the game design coding scripts and assets
(as well as the application itself). The EJS files for the website are then included everywhere else. If you would
like to run the game, simply download the application for the appropriate OS (windows or OSMac). To visit the
website simply go to: https://guayaki.herokuapp.com/.

  picture:
  - If you are making an account, make sure that your profile picture comes from online. 
  - So you can google for a picture. When you find one you like, make sure to right click it and press “open image in new
  tab”. Take the link of this new tab and insert that into the profile picture box. MAKE SURE that the link     is not 
  extremely long, if it is beyond a certain amount of characters, the website will return an error. Choose     an image with 
  a relatively short link.
