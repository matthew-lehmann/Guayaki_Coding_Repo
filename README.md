This is the source code for our project. The Unity files include all of the game design coding scripts and assets
(as well as the application itself). The EJS files for the website are then included everywhere else. If you would
like to run the game, simply download the application for the appropriate OS (windows or OSMac). To visit the
website simply go to: https://guayaki.herokuapp.com/.

Build/run code
  - Just visit the website https://guayaki.herokuapp.com/ to see the website. You can login to theking1's account to     what the profile page looks like
          Username: theking1  Password: 1234
  - If you want to create your own account make sure to follow the following instructions for inputting your profile     picture:
  - If you are making an account, make sure that your profile picture comes from online. 
  - So you can google for a picture. When you find one you like, make sure to right click it and press “open image       in new tab”. Take the link of this new tab and insert that into the profile picture box. MAKE SURE that the link     is not extremely long, if it is beyond a certain amount of characters, the website will return an error. Choose     an image with a relatively short link.
